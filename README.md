# 1. Insertion Sort Algorithm
   We start with insertino sort, which is an efficient algorithm for sorting a small number of elements. Insertion sort works the way many people sort a hand of playing cards. We start with an empty left hand and the cards face down on the table. we then remove one card at a time from the table and insert it into the correct position in the left hand. To find the correct position for a card, we compare  it with each of the cards already  in the haand, from right to left. At all times the cards fheld in the left hand are sorted, and these cards were originally the top cards of the pile on the table.Insertion sort  takes a parameter an array A[1 ..n]
